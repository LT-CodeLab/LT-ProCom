# Procom competition repository

You will find all questions from the ProCom competitions that we have attended, starting at ProCom 3.0.  In each, the README will have instructions for the question, including sample runs.  All starter code will be labeled with the problem name.

Current iteration will only include the java files, but will also include the python files in future iterations of the repository.

When you are adding a solution, label your solutions as <Problem #><Your Name>.java
